                Christmas Speech is usually given on Christmas day which is on 25th December every year. Kids look forward to
                this festival. Schools shut the classroom for this and also celebrate this day. Many events are conducted.
                Kids are encouraged to give the Best Christmas Speech Ever. It is a Christian holiday to celebrate the birth
                of Jesus Christ. But everyone celebrates this annual holiday that marks the goodness and togetherness of
                people.
