                            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with
                            building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human
                            intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches,
                            advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm
                            shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

                            Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, or even improve upon, the capabilities of
                            the human mind. And from the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of
                            generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, AI is increasingly becoming part of
                            everyday life — and an area companies across every industry are investing in.

                        education, will be badly hurt with job displacement … The simple question to ask is, ‘How
                        routine is a job?’ And that is how likely [it is] a job will be replaced by AI, because AI can,
                        within the routine task, learn to optimize itself. And the more quantitative, the more objective
                        the job is—separating things into bins, washing dishes, picking fruits and answering customer
                        service calls—those are very much scripted tasks that are repetitive and routine in nature. In
                        the matter of five, 10 or 15 years, they will be displaced by AI.” </div>

                        In Mendelson’s view, some of the most intriguing AI research and experimentation that will have
                        near-future ramifications is happening in two areas: “reinforcement” learning, which deals in
                        rewards and punishment rather than labeled data; and generative adversarial networks (GAN for
                        short) that allow computer algorithms to create rather than merely assess by pitting two nets
                        against each other. The former is exemplified by the prowess of Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo Zero,
                        the latter by original image or audio generation that’s based on learning about a certain
                        subject like celebrities or a particular type of music. </div>

                        On a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change
                        and environmental issues. Ideally and partly through the use of sophisticated sensors, cities
                        will become less congested, less polluted and generally more livable. </div>
