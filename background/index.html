                        be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                        JavaScript.

                        mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements
                        comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these
                        were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
                        (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
                        styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects
                        such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                        alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
                        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                        formatting.

                        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                        speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
                        for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                    <li class="b3">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
                        as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
                        intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
                        can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications
                        are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of
                        the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
                        low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such
                        as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
                        compiled languages.

                        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming
                        language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according
                        to GitHub and it is ranked fourth on TIOBE index as of October 2023. Although still
                        widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other
                        languages using JVM gaining popularity.

                        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995
                        as a core component of Sun's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java
                        compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
                        proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
                        Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only
                        license.
